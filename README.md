# Neuron Data Browser Container Deployment
NDB is a collection of services for managing annotated neuron data.

## Usage
After installation the various services are available on dedicated ports of the host machine.  For example, the SWC file 
services are available in the 965x range.

## Installation
The current implementation uses Docker with Docker Compose to manage the multiple independent services.

### Docker
A standard installation of Docker is sufficient.

The databases use Data Volumes. Starting, stopping, and removing/updating the service containers will not remove database 
contents.

### Operation
Most Docker Compose operations are wrapped in batch scripts to ensure the required flags are correct, e.g. test vs. 
production.

0. Backing up data

If this is not the first launch of the services, and the services are currently running, you can back up all database 
contents from the Data Volumes:
```
./backup.sh
```

Output goes to /opt/data/backup unless unless that mapping has been changed in the compose file.

1. Starting or restarting the services
```
./up.sh
```
The host environment variable ```TRANSFORM_VOL``` can be used to override the location on the host machine that will be 
mapped to ```/groups/mousebrainmicro/mousebrainmicro``` in the registration transform service container.  By default, 
this is ```/mnt/groups```.

The path to the Ontology Atlas for brain area lookup defaults to ```/groups/mousebrainmicro/mousebrainmicro/registration/Allen Atlas/OntologyAtlas.h5``` 
path ()from container perspective).  This can be overridden with the ```ONTOLOGY_PATH``` environment variable *passed to
the transform-api service in the docker compose file*.  It is not from a host env var.

2. Stopping services
```
./stop.sh
```

3. Tearing down services (retains data)
```
./down.sh
```
destroys existing service containers *but does not remove any data volumes.*  Newer container images can then be pulled 
and the services restarted with the *up* script.

4. Migration
```
./migrate.sh
```

5. Logs

```
./logs
```
will bring up the correct set of Compose logs for this container set (vs. test or any other deployment on the same host).
